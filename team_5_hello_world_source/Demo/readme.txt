    This folder contains plenty of experimentations of modules
    
    The ones of interest might be 'sim.cpp' which will generate a list of coordinates based on our custom wayfinding algorithm, 'Pathfinder'.
    
        Simply add Start coordinates and destination coordinates, along with wind direction and compile the program to see the path the boat would try to take.
